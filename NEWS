01 Aug 2005: First stable release of libvserver

I'm pleased to announce libvserver 0.3, the first release considered more or
less stable. This release supports the complete API of the Linux-VServer 2.0
kernel patches (libvserver.so) and provides additional helper functions such as
capability lists (libvserver-util.so). As of now, the public interface to
libvserver.so is not subject of change anymore.

An API doc is also available via doxygen, just use the provided Doxyfile or go
to http://dev.gentoo.org/~hollow/vserver/libvserver/doc/ for the latest API doc.

Have fun!
