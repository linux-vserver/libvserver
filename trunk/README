What is it?
===========

This is a clean implementation of the Linux-VServer 2.0 API using a library
which handles all vserver syscalls and provides a interface usable in other
applications such as the tools provided with libvserver.
The tools directory contains the most basic implementation of the syscall
commands in user space. High-level programs such as the "vserver" command of 
util-vserver can use these tools to access the VServer API.


What's wrong with libvserver from util-vserver?
===============================================

Short version:

<Bertl> I guess the main issue is that nobody can read enricos code well enough
        to fix/change it?

Long version:

The current alpha util-vserver package contains lots of obsoleted legacy code
and also contains huge wrapper functions to provide access to all previous
versions of the VServer API though making it quite hard to fix bugs or add new
features  in an adequate timeframe.


What can i do to help?
======================

Currently all syscalls are implemented in the library though very rough for now.
Additionally some tools already contain basic implementations of the library
such as vcontext, vnamespace, vsched and vsignal.
So you see there's still a lot of work to do...
