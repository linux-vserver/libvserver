What is it?
===========

This is a clean implementation of the Linux-VServer 2.0 API using a library
which handles all vserver syscalls and provides an interface usable in other
applications.

What's wrong with libvserver from util-vserver?
===============================================

The current alpha util-vserver package contains lots of obsoleted legacy code
and also contains huge wrapper functions to provide access to all previous
versions of the VServer API though making it quite hard to fix bugs or add new
features  in an adequate timeframe.


What can i do to help?
======================

Currently all syscalls are implemented in the library and the interface is
freezed, though libvserver-util needs some love...
